"""spanning.py

In this question your program will read a simple, weighted, undirected, and connected graph,
G(V, E, W), and compute:
  1. a smallest-weight spanning tree of G, and
  2. a second-smallest-weight spanning tree of G, whose weight is greater than or equal to the smallest.

To address this task, you must implement Kruskalâ€™s algorithm by employing union-by-rank
data structure with path compression.
